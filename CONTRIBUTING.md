# Contributing to MarketSage Backend

We love your input! We want to make contributing to MarketSage Backend as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Follow the existing code style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

## Commit Messages

We follow conventional commits:

  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
